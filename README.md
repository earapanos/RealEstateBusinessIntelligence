<h1 align="center"> ðŸŽ¯ FlorianÃ³polis Downtown Real estate Business Intelligence - Dashboard</h1>

This dashboard is a continuation of my <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/RealestateDataAnalysis">Data Analytics and Science project.</a> I developed this work independently and was responsible for creating the screens, selecting the KPIs, and establishing metrics for analyzing the square meter value in the central region of FlorianÃ³polis.

The dashboard was designed to be an interactive tool that enables real estate developers to understand the spatial distribution of the square meter value in downtown FlorianÃ³polis. It can also serve as a query tool for individuals looking to acquire property, providing access to information that facilitates the selection of a residential location.
